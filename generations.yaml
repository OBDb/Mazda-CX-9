    description: "The first-generation Mazda CX-9 was introduced as Mazda's flagship three-row crossover SUV, based on the Ford CD3 platform shared with the Ford Edge but significantly modified for its larger dimensions. The exterior featured sleek styling with a prominent front grille, arched fenders, and a gently sloping roofline that gave it a more dynamic appearance than many competitors. Powered by a 3.5L V6 engine initially producing 263 horsepower (upgraded to a 3.7L V6 with 273 horsepower in 2008), paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations. The interior offered three-row seating for up to seven passengers with surprising second-row space and a third row usable for adults on shorter trips. Available luxury features included leather seating, three-zone automatic climate control, Bose audio system, and a power liftgate. A significant refresh in 2010 brought updated exterior styling with Mazda's five-point grille, improved interior materials, and additional technology features. Despite its size, the CX-9 maintained Mazda's reputation for engaging driving dynamics with more responsive handling than typical three-row SUVs of the era. Safety features expanded throughout its production, eventually including blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and forward collision warning. This generation established the CX-9 as a stylish, driver-oriented alternative in the three-row crossover segment, balancing family practicality with a more engaging driving experience than many competitors."

    description: "The second-generation Mazda CX-9 represents a comprehensive redesign with more sophisticated styling, upscale interior, and a new turbocharged powertrain. Built on a Mazda-developed platform, it features KODO 'Soul of Motion' design language with elegant proportions, a long hood, and flowing body lines that create a more premium appearance. Significantly, Mazda replaced the previous V6 with a turbocharged 2.5L SkyActiv-G four-cylinder engine producing 227 horsepower (250 with premium fuel) and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available with front-wheel or i-Activ all-wheel drive. This new powertrain delivers more accessible low-end torque while improving fuel efficiency by up to 25% compared to its predecessor. The interior represents a major advance with premium materials throughout, including real aluminum and available genuine rosewood trim on the Signature trim, positioning it as a near-luxury vehicle. Despite being slightly shorter than the previous generation, improved packaging maintains interior space with comfortable seating for seven across three rows. Technology features include an available 8-inch (later 10.25-inch) infotainment display controlled by a rotary commander, 12-speaker Bose premium audio, and a comprehensive suite of i-Activsense safety features. Sound insulation was dramatically improved with acoustic glass and significantly more sound-deadening material, resulting in a notably quieter cabin. Updates throughout its production include the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability in 2019, upgraded infotainment with a larger display in 2021, and additional refinements to interior materials and technology. Throughout its production, the second-generation CX-9 has been acclaimed for its upscale design, refined driving dynamics, and premium interior quality, positioning it as a compelling alternative to luxury-brand SUVs while maintaining Mazda's driver-focused philosophy. Production ended in 2024, with the Mazda CX-90 serving as its successor."
